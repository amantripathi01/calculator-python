Scenario 1: Verify multiplication of two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_positive_numbers
  Description: The test is intended to verify the multiplication of two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive numbers num1 and num2.
  Act: Invoke the multiplication function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is the product of num1 and num2.
Validation:
  The importance of the test is to ensure that the function correctly multiplies two positive numbers. The expected result is the product of the two numbers which is in line with the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Verify multiplication of two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_negative_numbers
  Description: The test is intended to verify the multiplication of two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two negative numbers num1 and num2.
  Act: Invoke the multiplication function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is the product of num1 and num2.
Validation:
  The test is important to ensure that the function correctly multiplies two negative numbers. The expected result is the product of the two numbers which is in line with the function's specifications.

Scenario 3: Verify multiplication of a positive and a negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_positive_negative_numbers
  Description: The test is intended to verify the multiplication of a positive and a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a positive number num1 and a negative number num2.
  Act: Invoke the multiplication function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is the product of num1 and num2.
Validation:
  The test is important to ensure that the function correctly multiplies a positive and a negative number. The expected result is the product of the two numbers which is in line with the function's specifications.

Scenario 4: Verify multiplication of a number with zero
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_with_zero
  Description: The test is intended to verify the multiplication of a number with zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a number num1 and zero.
  Act: Invoke the multiplication function with num1 and zero as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is zero.
Validation:
  The test is important to ensure that the function correctly multiplies a number with zero. The expected result is zero which is in line with the function's specifications and mathematical rules.

Scenario 5: Verify multiplication of two floating point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_floating_point_numbers
  Description: The test is intended to verify the multiplication of two floating point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two floating point numbers num1 and num2.
  Act: Invoke the multiplication function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is the product of num1 and num2.
Validation:
  The test is important to ensure that the function correctly multiplies two floating point numbers. The expected result is the product of the two numbers which is in line with the function's specifications.
